Custom List Data Structure
This project provides a custom C++ header file for a list data structure that supports adding elements of different data types into a single list variable. It is designed for flexibility, allowing mixed data types within a single list instance. Currently, the functionality is limited to adding elements, with future enhancements planned for retrieval, deletion, and iteration.

Features
Mixed Data Type Support: Add elements of different types (e.g., integers, characters) into a single list.
Ease of Use: Simple interface for initializing and adding elements to the list.
Future Enhancements
Element retrieval and removal functions.
Iteration over elements in the list.
Further optimizations for memory and performance.
Getting Started
To use this list data structure, include the header file in your project, and start adding elements using the simple add function.

Custom List Data Structure Project
This project provides a custom list data structure in C++ that allows adding elements of various data types into a single variable. It currently supports adding elements only, with more features planned in the future.

Steps to Compile and Run
Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later. For example, you can use g++ on most systems.

Step 2: Compile the Code
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where your Executev1.cpp file is located.

Compile the code using the following command:

bash
Copy code
g++ -std=c++17 -o Executev1 Executev1.cpp (ExecuteV1 is sample file here where i am using that header file and performing operation you can use your file name here)
Step 3: Run the Program
After successful compilation, you can run the program with the following command:

bash
Copy code
./Executev1 (you can you your file name here )
Notes
Make sure all required header files are in the same directory or specified in your code.
This program is designed for testing the list structure's ability to store and handle mixed data types.
Future Enhancements
Add support for retrieving, deleting, and iterating through elements.
Additional optimizations for performance and memory management.
